# Getting Going with Gitea

[Gitea][gitea-home] describes itself as a painless self-hosted Git service.
It has many of the same features as Git[hub/lab], but is much more 
lightweight. 

This deployment runs in a Docker container on a Ubuntu 21.10 server.
The whole deployment uses ~2% of one CPU core, and ~2GB of RAM.
Easily runnable on a Raspberry Pi.


# Prerequisites
